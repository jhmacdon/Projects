Coin Toss
========

A simple coin toss flipping simulator, because why not.
(I was bored on the train, give me a break)

The function faced some error at 10,000,000 coins so I
broke it up into a kind of loop unrolling type of thing. 

Should work for up to 1,000,000,000,000,000 (or it may
timeout at 12000s, depends on your machine/time to waste)

NOT FULLY TESTED
My train got to its location before I was 100% done :)
