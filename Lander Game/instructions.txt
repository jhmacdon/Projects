<font size="16">Welcome to LM Simulator!</font><br><br>
Your goal is to land the simulator at a downward velocity of 5 m/s or less, 
while not running out of fuel (this will appear as -5 m/s). 

Click start to begin the game. Adjust the thrusters accordingly as you attempt to
land the lander.

The three difficulties are 'Easy', 'Medium', and 'Hard'. The difficulties
vary the amount of fuel you begin with. 

Fuel is only used when your thrusters are on. Freefalling will not
subtract from your fuel stores.

If you run out of fuel, your lander will freefall to the Lunar surface. If
you were close enough to the surface and traveling slow enough, it is
possible that the lander will land with a safe velocity.
