Utilized Dr. Baruch’s method for repainting panels so that one panel could control     
	elements in an entirely different panel

Nick Walker gave me the idea for the parallax effect with the stars.

Stackoverflow had some good answers as to how to remove jpanels from jpanels (method used in CenterPicture class) 
	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2501861/how-can-i-remove-a-jpanel-from-a-jframe

I used Dr. Baruch’s Circle.java and SplatPanel.java as a model for the 
	Star.java and StarPanel.java (though both classes have been expanded upon 
	to do things like the parallax effect and the image “lander.png” incorporation.
